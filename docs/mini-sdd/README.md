# Mini-SDD — Bounded-Change Documentation Sets

**Parent**: [README.md](../README.md)

A mini-SDD is the lightweight doc set (README.md + plan.md + tasks.md) for a bounded, low-ambiguity change. It follows the same pattern as `spex_backend` mini-SDDs:

- **README.md** — decisions, scope boundary, hard rules, risk warnings
- **plan.md** — architecture, verified repo facts, contracts, execution order, risk register
- **tasks.md** — checkbox execution checklist per phase with TDD gates

Mini-SDDs trim the *artifacts* of the full SDD cycle but **never** trim the quality gates (lint, TDD, bounds validation, docs sync, code review).

## When to use mini-SDD vs full SDD

| Aspect | Mini-SDD | Full SDD |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Change type | Bounded fixes, wiring, migrations, contract additions | Net-new subsystems, broad redesigns |
| Ambiguity | Low — decisions known upfront | Significant — needs Clarify phase |
| Artifacts | 3 files (README, plan, tasks) | 7+ files (spec → clarify → plan → contracts → risks → tasks → analyze → verify) |
| When to upgrade | If you're inventing requirements mid-mini-SDD | Start with full SDD |

## How to create a mini-SDD

1. Copy `_template/` to `<NNN>-<slug>/`
2. Fill in README.md with decisions, scope, locked choices
3. Fill in plan.md with verified repo facts, contracts, execution phases
4. Create tasks.md with per-phase checkboxes
5. Run `bounds validate --quick` to baseline
6. Proceed to implementation, crossing off tasks one at a time

## Mini-SDD index

| ID | Status | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| `001-data-plane-pipeline` | **DONE** — 118 tests | Full data-plane pipeline: STAC discovery → scene quality → COG read → preparation → baselines → change detection → evidence bundles → CLI. Phase 7 cleanup closed out by 002. |
| `002-baseline-fixes` | **DONE** — 114 tests | Complete pixel_delta stub, write task contract, close 001 Phase 7 |
| `003-clay-experiment` | **DONE** — 157 tests | Clay v1.5 adapter, tiled inference, --use-ai flag. PROCEED WITH CAUTION to 005. |
| `004-benchmark-dataset` | **GOLDEN TESTS RUN** — 11/12 baseline failures → 013 | Collect 12-18 reviewed before/after pairs, create golden integration tests. Phase 3 (run+calibrate) completed live on 2026-06-22 — 11/12 failed, confirming the need for 013-baseline-calibration. |
| `005-evaluation-harness` | **GATE RUN** — AI_ties | Full AI vs deterministic baseline comparison completed on 12 examples. Clay did not improve precision (`0.1266` vs `0.1266`), so AI remains experimental. |
| `006-model-registry-provenance` | **DONE** — 226 tests | Model registry, artifact index, provenance enrichment, COG cache, --json/--cache flags, API gap doc |
| `007-packaging-deployment` | **DONE** — 131 tests | Docker Compose (CPU+GPU), structured logging, health check, verified in container |
| `008-rust-control-plane` | **Phase 1+4 (Python) DONE** — 262 tests | Axum API, typed job contracts, SQLite state machine, Python subprocess. Python-side API contracts + serialization + CLI --request/--json wiring complete. Rust control plane deferred. |
| `009-launch-docs` | **Phase 0-3 DONE** — Phase 4 (partner prep) + Phase 6 (QA) deferred | README/ARCHITECTURE/ROADMAP rewrite, CLI polish + reference docs, SDK demo, reports verified. Phase 5 (PDF vaulting) cancelled. Phase 4 partner prep deferred. |
| `010-scene-composite` | **DONE** — 128 tests | Cloud-masked composite when single scene insufficient (Roadmap correction #2) |
| `011-review-workflow-monitoring` | After 008+005 | Portfolios, scheduled reruns, review states, alerts, feedback export (Roadmap Phase 8) |
| `012-security-hardening` | After 008+011 | API auth, audit logging, resource limits, SBOM, Docker hardening (Product Brief §10) |
| `013-baseline-calibration` | **DONE** — 277 tests | Reduce false positives in deterministic baseline: signed threshold (vegetation_disturbance = NDVI loss only), seasonal abstention (>40% AOI = broad), morphological closing (5x5). 16 new unit tests. |

### Recommended build sequence

```
Layer 1 — Core pipeline (build first)
  001 (DONE) → 002 → 010

Layer 2 — AI evaluation (gate: does AI earn its place?)
  003 → 004 → 005

Layer 3 — Stability + deployment
  006 → 007

Layer 4 — Control plane
  008

Layer 5 — Product + launch
  011 → 012 → 009
```

Each layer can proceed when its prerequisites are done. Layers 2 and 3 can run in parallel after Layer 1.

### Decision gates between phases

- **Gate 1** (after 003): Does Clay produce a sensible change map? If no → skip 004-005, go to 007.
- **Gate 2** (after 005): Does AI beat baseline? If no → deterministic-only default.
- **Gate 3** (after 007): Can external user reproduce? If no → fix packaging before features.
- **Gate 4** (after 008): Is Rust worth the complexity? If no → Python CLI as primary interface.
- **Gate 5** (after 011): Does monitoring create enough value to justify hosting? If no → keep as OSS tool.
